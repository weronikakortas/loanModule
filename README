Simple application based on hexagonal architecture.

Based functionalities:
 *fetch data if loan exist
 *add loan:
   - when is not add between hours which are specified in application properties
   - when loan is not bigger than max amount (configured in application properties)

Application with only few tests cover main functionality.

The commits are not in good orders :D it should be at least two commits and of course should be on another branch.

Tests only covers main functionality there should be much more tests.
